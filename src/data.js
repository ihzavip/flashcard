    note: "Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite—inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power.",

    title: "Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies.",
    note: "Be wary of friends—they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.",

    title: "Conceal your intentions.",
    note: "Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide them far enough down the wrong path, envelop them in enough smoke, and by the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late.",

    title: "Always say less than necessary.",
    note: "When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish. Silence generally makes people uncomfortable - they will jump in and nervously fill the silence.Generally saying less makes you appear more profound and mysterious. Be particularly careful with sarcasm - rarely is it valuable. Be careful with arousing suspicion or insecurity by being silent.  At times it is easier to blend by playing the jester.",
